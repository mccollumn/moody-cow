## Project Overview

A web app that detects user's mood using facial expressions or text analysis and suggests music tailored to that mood. Playlists are dynamic and update as the user's mood changes.

## Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Stack

- **Next.js 15** with App Router for the web framework
- **Material UI 7** for consistent and modern UI components
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling (alongside Material UI)

### Backend & Data

- **Prisma** with PostgreSQL for database ORM
- **Spotify Web API** for music streaming and tracks
- **Face-api.js** or **TensorFlow.js** for facial expression analysis
- **Sentiment analysis library** for text-based mood detection

### Key Features Architecture

1. **Mood Detection Service**

   - Facial expression analysis using camera
   - Text sentiment analysis
   - Mood classification (happy, sad, energetic, calm, etc.)

2. **Music Recommendation Engine**

   - Spotify API integration
   - Mood-to-genre mapping
   - Dynamic playlist generation
   - User feedback learning system

3. **State Management**

   - User profile and preferences
   - Current detected mood
   - Playlist and playback status
   - UI state (camera permissions, loading states)

4. **Database Schema**
   - Users table (profiles, preferences)
   - Moods table (mood history, timestamps)
   - Playlists table (saved playlists, sharing)
   - UserFeedback table (learning from user interactions)
