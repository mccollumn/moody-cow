# Core Requirements

- The end goal is stability, speed, security, and great user experience.

## Code Quality Requirements

- Code must be clean, readable, and maintainable.
- Follow standard TypeScript conventions and best practices.
- Use TypeScript's type system effectively to catch errors at compile time.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity; keep the code simple and straightforward.
- Use comments to explain complex logic or important decisions.
- Ensure proper and consistent error handling and logging.
- Use functional components and hooks where appropriate.
- Avoid using class components unless absolutely necessary.
- Ensure code is modular and reusable.
- Use ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals.
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles where appropriate.
- Accessibility should be considered in all UI components.
- Ensure that the code is compatible with modern browsers and follows best practices for cross-browser compatibility.
- Avoid using inline styles; use CSS modules or styled-components for styling.
- Use Material UI components where appropriate for consistency and ease of use.
- Use Material UI's theming capabilities to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.

- Write unit tests for critical functions and components using `jest` with `@testing-library/react`.
- Write end-to-end tests using `playwright`.
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`.
- Use `async/await` for asynchronous code instead of callbacks or `.then()` chains.
- Use `import` statements instead of `require`.
- Use `eslint` and `prettier` for code formatting and linting.
- Use `useEffect` and `useMemo` hooks to optimize performance where necessary.
- This project uses Next.js app router, so follow its conventions for file structure and routing.
- Use TypeScript interfaces and types to define props and state for components.
